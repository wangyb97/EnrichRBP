Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation, influencing processes such as splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA localization, translation, and stability. These proteins are key to understanding the dynamics of gene expression and the regulatory networks that govern cellular function. Aberrations in RBP function have been linked to numerous diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and metabolic syndromes, making the study of RBPs critical for both basic biology and translational medicine.

Despite their importance, the prediction and characterization of RBP-RNA interactions remain challenging due to the complex nature of these interactions and the vast diversity of RNA sequence and structure. Traditional experimental approaches, while valuable, are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Computational methods have thus emerged as indispensable tools, offering scalable and efficient solutions to predict RBP binding sites, elucidate their functional significance, and generate hypotheses for further experimental validation. However, developing and deploying such models typically requires substantial computational resources and expertise in both machine learning and bioinformatics, posing a barrier for many researchers.

To address these challenges, there is a growing demand for platforms that combine automation, interpretability, and accessibility. These platforms should not only provide accurate predictions but also offer insights into the functional relevance of specific sequence regions. Additionally, they should lower the technical barriers for biologists, enabling broader adoption and application of advanced computational methods in RNA biology.
